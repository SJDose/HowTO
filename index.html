  <!-- h2 for subtitle -->
  <h2 style="background-color:#0d0033;color:#cc66ff"> What is it?</h2>
    <!-- p for my paragraph -->
    <p>The type of paper art I'll be teaching you how to make is one that I have used<!-->using A link here</--> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXhEQGQl4GM/?taken-by=lastlamb_art" target="_blank">multiple times.</a>
    <br>It invloves cutting out the shadows of an image and putting that over a watercolor background. </p>
  <h2 style="background-color:#0d0033;color:#cc66ff;">What You'll Need</h2>
    <p>The supplies needed are fairly flexible for this project, so feel free to substitute the ones listed here for more readily availabe supplies</p>
    <ul><!-- I used an unodered list -->
      <li>Thick white paper of desired size</li><!-- with list items -->
      <li>Water color paper of the same size</li>
      <li>Water color paints</li>
      <li>Soft bristle brushes (the more absorbment the better)</li>
      <li>Exacto knife</li>
      <li>Glue</li>
      <li>Reference photo (in grayscale)</li>
      <li>Sharpie</li>
      <li>Pencil</li>
      <li>Transparency sheet or tracing paper (optional) </li>    
    </ul>
  <h2 style="background-color:#0d0033;color:#cc66ff;">The Process</h2>
      <p>Time to start working!</p>
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
      <p>To start you'll need to simplify your reference photo. You'll do this by drawing on top of it with your sharpie.
      <br>If you want to preserve the photo just tape the transparency or tracing paperover the top of the photo and draw on that instead.
      <br>Draw over the image with simple straight lines, you can be as detailed as you want. Then you need to outline and fill in the shadows you'll be cutting out.
      <br>Try to make sure that none of your shadows or lines go of the page, otherwise when you cut them out you'll end up with a bunch of puzzle pieces.
      <br>Another step you might want to do is to draw a grid over your picture. This will make keeping you picture proportional easier.
      </p>
    <h3>The Main Drawing</h3>
      <p>If you want to you can create the background before or during this step.</p>
      
      <p>Take your thick paper (not the water color paper!) and start drawing. If you created a grid on your reference photo then make another one, proportional to your first one, on your larger paper.
      <br>Then copy the lines you made on your picture onto your paper. Use your pencil and draw lightly so you can easily erase the lines.</p>
      
      <p>Now you're ready to cut! Carefully use your exacto nknife to cut out the shadows.
      <br>If there are lines that you want to be seen, but are not a part of a shadow then cut out a small rectangle where those lines are.
      <br>Try and make sure different lines don't touch or your paper could turn into a mess.</p>
    
    <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Take your water color paper and paint it.
      <br>It's that easy. If you want to you can paint a picture or the colors of your drawing.
      <br>Or you could just randomly paint.</p>
      
    <h3>Put It Together</h3>
      <p>Now just glue your drawing to the background and you have your masterpeice!</p>
